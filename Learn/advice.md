Ignoring `__pycache__` absolutely and removing the hint is a two-step process:

1.  **Ensure absolute ignore in `.gitignore`** (it's likely correct, but checking guarantees it).
2.  **Turn off the Git hint** permanently.

Here are the commands and steps:

-----

## 1\. Absolute Ignore for `__pycache__`

To ensure `__pycache__` is ignored everywhere in your project, add the following line to your project's `.gitignore` file:

```gitignore
__pycache__/
```

If you have other temporary Python files you want to be sure to ignore, you can add this set as a standard practice:

```gitignore
# Python bytecode files
*.py[co]

# Python cache directory (absolute ignore)
__pycache__/

# Virtual environment directory (common practice)
venv/
.venv/
```

## 2\. Removing the Hint Message ðŸ¤«

The "hint: Use -f if you really want to add them" message is a safety feature, but since you are confident these files should be ignored, you can turn off the warning with the following command:

```bash
git config advice.addIgnoredFile false
```

### Explanation of the command:

  * **`git config`**: Modifies Git configuration settings.
  * **`advice.addIgnoredFile`**: The specific configuration key that controls the display of the hint when trying to add an ignored file.
  * **`false`**: Sets the value to turn the hint off.

**Where is this setting saved?** By default, this command sets the configuration locally (for the current repository only). If you want to disable this hint for **all** your Git repositories, use the `--global` flag:

```bash
git config --global advice.addIgnoredFile false
```

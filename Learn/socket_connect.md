In the context of socket programming in Python, the numbers 220 and 250 are not directly related to the socket module itself but are commonly associated with SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) responses. These codes are returned by an SMTP server when a client connects to it or performs specific actions.

Hereâ€™s what they mean:

220: This is a standard SMTP response code indicating that the server is ready to accept a connection. For example, when a client connects to an SMTP server, the server might respond with 220 <domain> Service ready.

250: This response code indicates that the requested action has been completed successfully. For instance, after sending an email command like MAIL FROM or RCPT TO, the server might respond with 250 OK.

If you're using Python's socket module to connect to an SMTP server, you might see these codes in the server's response after establishing a connection or sending commands. Here's a simple example:

import socket

# Connect to an SMTP server
server = "smtp.example.com"
port = 25  # Standard SMTP port
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
client_socket.connect((server, port))

# Receive the server's response (e.g., 220)
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Server Response:", response)

# Send an EHLO command to the server
client_socket.sendall(b"EHLO example.com\r\n")
response = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
print("Server Response:", response)

client_socket.close()


In this example:

The first response after connect is likely to be 220.
After sending the EHLO command, you might receive a 250 response.

If you're not working with SMTP but still see these codes, they might be part of a custom protocol or application-layer communication. Let me know if you'd like further clarification! ðŸ˜Š

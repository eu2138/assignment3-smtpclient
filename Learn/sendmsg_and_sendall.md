The phrase "**send data command**" doesn't refer to a single universal command, but rather a **function** or **verb** used across many different technologies to initiate data transfer.

The specific command depends entirely on **where** you are sending the data (a local file, a remote server, a programming socket, etc.).

Here are the most common examples of "send data commands" grouped by context:

-----

## 1\. File Transfer (Between Computers) üåê

These commands are used in a command-line interface (CLI) to copy entire files or directories over a network.

| Environment | Command | Protocol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linux/macOS** | **`scp`** | SSH/SCP | **Secure Copy.** Copies files securely between hosts using SSH. |
| **Linux/macOS** | **`rsync`** | RSync | **Remote Sync.** Highly efficient; only transfers the differences between files. |
| **Any CLI** | **`ftp`** or **`sftp`** | FTP/SFTP | **File Transfer Protocol.** Used for traditional file transfers. |
| **Windows CMD** | **`robocopy`** | SMB | **Robust File Copy.** A powerful utility for copying files and directories. |
| **Windows CMD** | **`copy \\\\remotehost\share\file`** | SMB | Copies a file to a network share (if accessible). |

### Example (`scp`):

```bash
# Copies local_file.txt to the home directory of 'user' on 'remotehost'
scp local_file.txt user@remotehost:~/
```

## 2\. Low-Level Networking (Sockets/Protocols) üíª

In programming or network analysis, these are functions used to send raw bytes over a connection.

| Language/API | Command/Function | Context | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python Socket** | **`sock.send(data)`** | Connected Sockets (TCP) | Sends the specified byte string `data` to the connected peer. |
| **Python Socket** | **`sock.sendall(data)`** | Connected Sockets (TCP) | Guarantees that *all* data is sent, blocking as necessary. (Preferred for reliable streams). |
| **Python Socket** | **`sock.sendto(data, address)`** | Unconnected Sockets (UDP) | Sends a datagram to the specified `address`. |
| **C/C++** | **`send()`** | Socket API | The core function for sending data on a socket. |
| **C/C++** | **`sendmsg()`** | Socket API | Used for advanced operations like scatter/gather I/O and passing file descriptors (as in your previous question). |

### Example (Python):

```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('example.com', 80))

# Send data (an HTTP request)
s.sendall(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n") 
```

## 3\. Web/HTTP Communication üì°

These are commands or tools used to send data (usually in the form of an HTTP request) to a web server.

| Tool | Command | HTTP Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLI Tool** | **`curl`** | POST/PUT | A versatile command-line tool used to transfer data from or to a server. |
| **CLI Tool** | **`wget`** | GET | Primarily used to *retrieve* files, but can send some data via URL parameters. |

### Example (`curl` for POSTing JSON data):

```bash
# Sends JSON data to a server
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key": "value"}' https://api.service.com/data
```
